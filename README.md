# UW Drupal Theme â€“ Readme

## Getting Started

First, download (or clone) the theme into your Drupal 7 theme folder.

```
cd sites/all/themes
git clone git@github.com:uw-drupal/UW-Drupal-Theme.git
```

You'll also need to download and enable the bootstrap theme:

```
drush dl bootstrap
drush en -y bootstrap
```

Download the [Bootstrap library v2.3.x](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and extract it such that you have `sites/all/themes/bootstrap/bootstrap/...`
